# ArcTwitter
A Visualization Tool developed during [NC Emergency Management Hackshop](http://technologytank.org/2015/10/16/emergency-management-hackshop-wilmington-nov-6-7/) with teammates from ESRI.
This website visualized the geographic location of tweets that contained keywords, such as "Rainstorm", "Tornado", etc.
The purpose of the tool was to help emergency services identify where disasters occur without awaiting for official reports, which may take days to receive.

The tool had different features, such as viewing the raw geographic locations, clustering, and heatmap visualizations.
Since the tool was only developed for a hackshop, the input was fixed to only the options below; however, this work could always be repurposed for realtime.
